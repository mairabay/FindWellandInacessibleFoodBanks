# FindWellandInacessibleFoodBanks

 This (Talend OS DI 5.6.1) job finds food banks that are inacessible by public transit in the city of Welland, ON.
 
 It uses the following datasets from Niagara Open Data (http://niagaraopendata.ca):
 - Welland Transit Stops
 - Niagara Food Banks
 
Accessible is considered within a 1/4 mile or 5-min walk (according to: http://evstudio.com/the-five-minute-walk-calibrated-to-the-pedestrian/).
I used this site to calculate how many decimals in lat and long is equivalent to a 1/4 mile: http://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/haversine/
